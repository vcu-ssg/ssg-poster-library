# Background 

The Byrd Park Pump House was constructed between 1881-1883 to serve as the waterworks
for the City of Richmond. The downstairs contained a water-powered pumping station,
while the upstairs featured a large open-air pavilion that hosted lavish events and dances
until the mid-1920’s. After its closure in 1924, all the machinery within was sold as scrap metal.
The Friends of Pump House is a non-profit organization that works to preserve, protect, and
restore the Pump House. The organization tasked VCU with recreating the original
machinery to understand the scale and importance of the pump house machinery.
Previous student teams researched the layout of the pumphouse and period-accurate machinery
to create a detailed 3D pump model and a preliminary AR implementation.

# Achievements

The current student team built off preexisting assets to create an educational
aid for use by Friends of Pump House. An interactive aid usable for both remote
and on-site at the Pump House was to help generate interest in the restoration
of the Pump House, as well as raise awareness of the Pump House’s
historical significance.

# Project Design

## Features

• Fully engaged/ Immersive: Can move and explore the pumphouse without being at the location
• Interactable: Interact with the different machinery
• Audiovisual Experience: Hear what the pumphouse sounded like

## Audience/Use

• Schools: Could be used to teach students about the Pump House
• Kids: Would be more interested in the new technology.
• Educational Video Aid
• Accessible from Home and People with disability
• Generate Funding: Could be shown to potential donors without them being physically present at the pumphouse

# VR Application

(add sample images)

# Asset Development

From MNE-504 and MULT-603, we have access to in-depth research about the Pump House and 3D
models of the machinery. Future artists will design and implement models of Generator, Hydroelectric
Generator, Switchboard, Boiler, Leffel Turbine.

These 3D objects will replace place holders used in our VR application.

# Future Adaptation

Possible enhancements to out current application:

• Working with artists to enhance the quality of our 3D models.
• Exporting project to IOS or Android tablet for in-hand experience.
• Altering Unity project for augmented reality deployment on XR headset
• Extension of Hydroelectric and Boiler room
