This poster template would use the VCU Brand Standard fonts and colors, and implement a pleasing and easily modifiable format.\nA researcher would create a QMD file using a text editor (VS code?), modify the YAML header and add their content to create a picture-perfect, cleanly formatted poster. No formatting or other goofiness, the template would manage the layout.\nThis template could take one of two forms:\n\nA YAML header for a QMD file that contains all the necessary font, color, icon, background and other settings. This is the preferred approach.\nA true quarto extension that contains all the necessary files, etc., ready for use. This is a more complicated approach, but might be useful if there are lots of options and built-in icons, images and/or logos.\n\nThis project may be a simple as reading the documentation and adding the necessary commands to the YAML header. But, if the extension is not documented well, it make take more effort."
