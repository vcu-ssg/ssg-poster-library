This poster template would use the VCU Brand Standard fonts and colors, and implement a pleasing and easily modifiable format, printed directly to PDF without the need for google slides, powerpoint, or figma.\nThe user creates a QMD file using a text editor (VS code?), modifies the YAML header, then adds their content to the QMD. Stylings, layout and formatting is left to the template styles.\nWhen the QMD is rendered, Quarto would create a PDF of the appropriate size, perfect for printing on large poster paper and mounting on poster board. No powerpoint, no google slides, no interim files, no mouse surgery. Because it’s Quarto, formulas, computations, images and all the goodies can be embed into the single Quarto QMD file. AND, it would all live cleanly within a github repo."
