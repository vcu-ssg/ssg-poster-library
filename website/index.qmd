This site is home to a project to create a Quarto poster template for VCU Engineering capstone and other projects.

<style>
    .bold-center {
        font-weight: bold;
        font-style: italic;
        font-size: 4em;
        text-align: center;
        color: black;
    }
    .pdf-container {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
    }
    .pdf-container iframe {
        width: 48%;
        height: 500px; /* Adjust height as needed */
    }

I need your help!

## VISION

My vision is a [Quarto poster template](./assets/CS%2024-313_Poster.pdf) customized for VCU Capstone projects,
easily customizable for other VCU-related activities.  This poster template
would use the VCU Brand Standard fonts and colors, and implement a pleasing
and easily modifiable format, printed directly to PDF without the need for google slides, powerpoint, or figma.

The user creates a QMD file using a text editor (VS code?), modifies the YAML header, then adds their content to the QMD. Stylings, layout
and formatting is left to the template styles.

When the QMD is rendered, Quarto would create a PDF of the appropriate size, perfect for printing on large poster paper and mounting on poster board.
No powerpoint, no google slides, no interim files, no mouse surgery.  Because it's Quarto, formulas, computations, images and all the goodies can
be embed into the single Quarto QMD file. AND, it would all live cleanly within a github repo.

## Starting point

We've got a starting point.  Below is a sample poster created using Quarto and the typst extension:

![](./showcase-2024-10-31/showcase-2024-10-31.pdf){width=500px height=380px fig-align="center"}

Below is an example of a completed VCU poster, prepared manually using powerpoint:

![](./assets/CS%2024-313_Poster.pdf){width=500px height=380px fig-align="center"}

The student team needed to manually place all the elements and tweak things to make them look good.  Each and every
student team needs to manually prepare their posters, consuming valuable time that could and should be directed to
project tasks, rather than mundane poster preparation.

## A proposed YAML header

If we build this template, I envision the YAML header below would be used to create the final pumphouse poster (above). 

Note that YAML header elements align with specific elements on the final poster. The extension/tool would place the contents from the YAML header directly into the appropriate spot on the
template without the use doing anything.

    (other stuff to set header and footer logos, colors, fonts per typst.  If missing, use defaults.)

Again, note how the the *Heading1* sections align with those in the final poster.  A user of the template need only
identify and complete the sections, and the template would lay things out automatically.  In this case, it's filling three columns from top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

## Preferred approach

I believe that the best way to accomplish this project is to create a new *typst* extension format.  Below are instructions for getting started.

* [Instructions are here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst-custom.html#create-a-format)

I envision the initial extension named "poster-vcu-capstone". Future extensions could be customized for student projects, faculty research labs, department posters, etc.

## Additional samples

The link below provide an example of what we're starting with (a template Quarto poster) and our desired product - an easily usable 

* [Sample Typst Poster](./showcase-2024-10-31/showcase-2024-10-31.pdf) - a sample poster created using the Quarto typst poster format. It definitely needs work
to use VCU colors, fonts, and other features to make RAM-alicious!

Below are posters from the 2024 capstone expo.  Note the consistent use of headers, footers, colors, logos, and all that other stuff that make these posters look related to each other.  These were created using powerpoint and required lots of manual layout.  

* [CS-24-313](./assets/CS%2024-313_Poster.pdf) - Example poster from Capstone project CS-24-313, Pumphouse Machinery AR Implementation.

* [CS-24-333](./assets/CS%2024-333_Poster.pdf) - Example poster from Capstone project CS-24-333, Implementation of a STEMM

* [Other Projects](https://egr.vcu.edu/capstone/current-projects/) - An index of all projects from 2023-24 capstone projects. Each project provides a PDF abstract and a PDF poster. SCROLL DOWN, the list starts in the middle of the file.
